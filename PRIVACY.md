# Privacy Protection with VaultGemma

## Overview

This document explains how the Document Identification system implements privacy protection using Google's VaultGemma model with differential privacy guarantees.

## üîê What is VaultGemma?

VaultGemma is Google's breakthrough 1-billion parameter language model that provides **mathematically-backed privacy guarantees** through differential privacy. Unlike traditional models that may memorize training data, VaultGemma ensures that:

- **No individual data point can be identified** from model outputs
- **Privacy is built-in from training**, not added as an afterthought  
- **Mathematical guarantees** prevent data leakage
- **Enterprise-grade security** for sensitive document processing

## üõ°Ô∏è Differential Privacy Explained

### What is Differential Privacy?

Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that provides **provable privacy guarantees**. It ensures that the presence or absence of any single individual's data in a dataset does not significantly affect the outcome of any analysis.

### How It Works

```
Œµ-differential privacy: 
- Œµ (epsilon) = privacy budget
- Lower Œµ = stronger privacy, less accuracy
- Higher Œµ = weaker privacy, more accuracy
- Noise ~ Laplace(sensitivity/Œµ)
```

### Privacy Budget System

Our system implements a **privacy budget** mechanism:

1. **Initial Budget**: Each user starts with 1.0 epsilon
2. **Consumption**: Each document classification consumes 0.1 epsilon
3. **Enforcement**: When budget is exhausted, processing is blocked
4. **Reset**: Budgets can be reset manually or on schedule

## üîí Privacy Features

### 1. Secure Document Processing
- **In-Memory Processing**: Documents processed without disk storage
- **Immediate Cleanup**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use
- **Encrypted Storage**: All documents encrypted with AES-256
- **Secure Deletion**: Multi-pass overwrite for permanent deletion

### 2. Privacy-Preserving Classification
- **Differential Privacy**: Mathematical noise added to prevent data leakage
- **Budget Tracking**: Per-user privacy budget monitoring
- **Audit Logging**: All privacy operations logged for compliance
- **Access Controls**: User-based document access restrictions

### 3. Data Minimization
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for document classification
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic deletion after retention period
- **Minimal Collection**: Only necessary data is processed
- **Anonymization**: User identifiers protected in logs

## üìä Privacy Budget Management

### Budget Allocation
```
Default Configuration:
- Initial Budget: 1.0 epsilon per user
- Per-Classification Cost: 0.1 epsilon
- Maximum Classifications: 10 per budget period
- Reset Policy: Manual or scheduled
```

### Budget Status API
```bash
GET /api/secure/privacy-budget
Authorization: Basic <credentials>

Response:
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "usedBudget": 0.3,
  "maxBudget": 1.0,
  "remainingBudget": 0.7,
  "budgetExceeded": false
}
```

### Budget Reset
```bash
POST /api/secure/privacy-budget/reset
Authorization: Basic <credentials>

Response:
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "budgetReset": true,
  "message": "Privacy budget has been reset"
}
```

## üîç Privacy Guarantees
